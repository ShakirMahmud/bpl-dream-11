### Project Description
The Ultimate Dream 11 Cricket Team Selector is a fantasy cricket app designed to give users a realistic and engaging experience in assembling their dream team. This application lets users select players, manage coins, and receive real-time feedback, all within a well-designed and responsive interface. Built with simplicity and usability in mind, the app offers an intuitive experience for users to build a team while staying within budget limits.

### Technologies Used
- **React**: For creating reusable, dynamic UI components and state management.

   - Success, warning, and error notifications provide instant feedback on user actions, guiding them through the team selection process and ensuring an intuitive user journey.

4. **Interactive User Interface**
